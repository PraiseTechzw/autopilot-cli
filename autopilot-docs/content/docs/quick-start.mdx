# Quick Start Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up Autopilot CLI in a new project and demonstrating its core functionality.

## 1. Setup a Project

First, let's create a new directory and initialize a git repository. Autopilot requires an existing git repo to function.

```bash
mkdir my-new-project
cd my-new-project
git init
```

## 2. Initialize Autopilot

Run the initialization command to generate the default configuration file:

```bash
autopilot init
```

This creates a `.autopilotrc.json` file in your project root. You can inspect it, but the defaults are fine for now.

## 3. Recommended Workflow: Use a Dev Branch

By default, Autopilot is configured **NOT** to push to protected branches like `main` or `master` for safety reasons. We strongly recommend working on a feature or development branch.

Create and switch to a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b develop
```

## 4. Start the Watcher

Now, start the background daemon. This command will spawn a separate process that watches your files.

```bash
autopilot start
```

You should see a message confirming that the watcher has started.

## 5. Make Some Changes

Now for the magic. Create a new file or modify an existing one.

```bash
echo "Hello Autopilot" > README.md
```

Wait a few seconds (default debounce is ~30 seconds). Autopilot will detect the change, stage it, create a conventional commit message (e.g., `docs: update README.md`), and push it to your remote `develop` branch.

## 6. Monitor Status

You can check what the daemon is doing at any time:

```bash
autopilot status
```

This will tell you if the service is `running`, `stopped`, or if it encountered an error.

## 7. Stop the Watcher

When you are finished coding for the session, stop the background process:

```bash
autopilot stop
```

## Viewing Logs

If something isn't working as expected, you can check the logs. Autopilot writes logs to the `.autopilot` directory in your project root (this directory is added to `.gitignore` automatically during init).

To view the latest logs:

```bash
cat .autopilot/autopilot.log
```

**Common Log Entries:**
- `[INFO] File changed: README.md` - Watcher detected a file event.
- `[INFO] Debounce timer triggered` - Waiting for more changes before committing.
- `[SUCCESS] Committed and pushed` - Operation completed successfully.
- `[WARN] Protected branch detected` - Autopilot skipped the push to avoid messing up `main`.
